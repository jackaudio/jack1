.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBjackd\fR is the JACK audio server daemon, a low\-latency audio
server.  Originally written for the
GNU/Linux operating system, it also supports Mac OS X and various Unix
platforms.  JACK can connect a number of different client applications
to an audio device and also to each other.  Most clients are external,
running in their own processes as normal applications.  JACK also
supports internal clients, which run within the \fBjackd\fR process
using a loadable "plugin" interface.

JACK differs from other audio servers in being designed from the
ground up for professional audio work.  It focuses on two key areas:
synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.

For the latest JACK information, please consult the web site,
<\fBhttp://www.jackaudio.org\fR>.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-driver \fIbackend\fR [\fIbackend\-parameters\fR ]
.br
Select the audio interface backend.  The current list of supported
backends is: \fBalsa\fR, \fBcoreaudio\fR, \fBdummy\fR, \fBfreebob\fR,
\fBoss\fR \fBsun\fR \fBportaudio\fR and \fB sndio.  They are not all available
on all platforms.  All \fIbackend\-parameters\fR are optional.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
.br
Print a brief usage message describing the main \fBjackd\fR options.
These do not include \fIbackend\-parameters\fR, which are listed using
the \fB\-\-help\fR option for each specific backend.  Examples below
show how to list them.
.TP
\fB\-m, \-\-no\-mlock\fR
Do not attempt to lock memory, even if \fB\-\-realtime\fR.
.TP
\fB\-A \fIdevice\fR, \fB\-A \fIdevice%p\fR, \fB\-A \fIdevice%c\fR
.br
(Linux-only) A simplified way to add additional audio I/O hardware to an instance
of JACK. This argument is actually just a wrapper around the -I
(internal client) version, requiring only the name of the ALSA "card"
to be used. The name should \fBNOT\fR include any ALSA device access
prefix (e.g. "hw:" or "plughw:") but can include a
subdevice. If %p is added to the device name, it will be made
available for playback only. If %c is added to the device name, it
will be made available for capture (recording) only. If neither %p nor
%c is added, it will be made available (if possible) for both capture
and playback. Although device names may be visible in various places
on your system, the file /proc/asound/cards shows them inside square
braces. 
.br
Examples:
.br
-A SB   (adds playback and capture for the "SB" device)
.br
-A Codec,1%c  (adds capture (recording) for the 2nd subdevice of the "Codec" device)
.br
-A MT1a2%p   (adds playback the 1st subdevice of the "MT1a2" device)
.br
The use of -A CARD is actually equivalent to -I foo:zalsa_in/-dhw:CARD
\fIand\fR -I CARD:zalsa_out/-dhw:CARD. 
.br
The use of -A CARD%p is actually equivalent to  -I CARD:zalsa_out/-dhw:CARD. 
.br
The use of -A CARD%c is actually equivalent to -I CARD:zalsa_in/-dhw:CARD
.br
.br
Note that this option (like -I) can be used regardless of the backend
used, so even if you do not use the ALSA backend, you can still add
ALSA-supported devices to an instance of JACK.
.TP
\fB\-I, \-\-internal-client \fIclient-spec\fR
.br
Load \fIclient-name\fR as an internal client. May be used multiple
times. The form of \fIclient-spec\fR can be any of the following:
.br
client-path
.br
client-name:client-path
.br
client-name:client-path/init-string
.br
client-path/init-string
.br
The first form will cause jackd to attempt to load the client from a
shared object named "client-path" with appropriate suffixes
appended. If "client-path" is absolute, jackd will use that (adding
a platform appropriate suffix for a shared object). If it is not
absolute, jackd will look for "client-path" (with an appropriate
suffix) in the same location that drivers and other JACK add-ons are
located.
.br
The second form provides "client-name" as the desired name for the
client once loaded, in addition to the "client-path".
.br
The third form provides an "init-string" in addition to a client name
and path, which will be passed to the client's initialization
function.
.br
The final form does not specify the client name, but does include 
the path to the client's shared object file and an initializations
string.
.br
When invoking JACK from the shell, remember to quote the argument to
-I if it includes spaces.
.TP
\fB\-M, \-\-midi\-bufsize\fR [ \fIevent-count\fR ]
Specify the size of the buffer used for MIDI ports. Units are "MIDI
events per process() cycle", where an event occupies up to 4 bytes (as most common MIDI events
do). The default buffer size is 2048 bytes, which is about 500 MIDI events.
Typical values for \fIevent-count\fR will range from 10 to about
1000. Be aware that using very high values along with a large number of
ports may  cause JACK to fail to start because of the amount of memory 
that would be required.
.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-name\fR \fIserver\-name\fR
Name this \fBjackd\fR instance \fIserver\-name\fR.  If unspecified,
this name comes from the \fB$JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER\fR environment
variable.  It will be "default" if that is not defined.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-port\-max \fI n\fR
Set the maximum number of ports the JACK server can manage.  
The default value is 256.
.TP
\fB\-\-replace-registry\fR 
.br
Remove the shared memory registry used by all JACK server instances
before startup. This should rarely be used, and is intended only
for occasions when the structure of this registry changes in ways
that are incompatible across JACK versions (which is rare).
.TP
\fB\-R, \-\-realtime\fR 
.br
Use realtime scheduling (default = true). This is needed for reliable low\-latency
performance.  On many systems, it requires \fBjackd\fR to run with
special scheduler and memory allocation privileges, which may be
obtained in several ways. 
.TP
\fB\-r, \-\-no-realtime\fR
.br
Do not use realtime scheduling. 
.TP
\fB\-P, \-\-realtime\-priority \fIint\fR
When running \fB\-\-realtime\fR, set the scheduler priority to
\fIint\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-silent\fR
Silence any output during operation.
.TP
\fB\-S, \-\-sync\fR
.br
This option does nothing in this implementation of JACK, but exists
for command-line compatibility with JACK2 and possibly other versions.
.TP
\fB\-T, \-\-temporary\fR
Exit once all clients have closed their connections.
.TP
\fB\-t, \-\-timeout \fIint\fR
.br
Set client timeout limit in milliseconds.  The default is 500 msec.
.TP
\fB\-X, \-\-slave-driver\fR \fIdriver-name\fR
.br
Asks the server to load the "slave" driver given by
\fIdriver-name\fR. Slave drivers can provide builtin-access to other
devices and protocols; the primary slave-driver at this time is the
"alsa_midi" one which provides bridging on Linux between native ALSA
MIDI and JACK MIDI.
.TP
\fB\-Z, \-\-nozombies\fR
.br
Prevent JACK from ever kicking out clients because they were too slow.
This cancels the effect any specified timeout value.
.TP
\fB\-C, \-\-timeout-thres \fItime\fR
.br
Stop processing clients if JACK cannot complete the process cycle in time (typically caused by CPU overloading or misbehaved clients). The optional \fItime\fR 
argument specifies the number of miliseconds, during which consectutive process cycles must fail before JACK gives up (if the argument is not given, it defaults to 250). Processing will resume on the next change to the port 
graph (i.e. a port is added, removed, connected or disconnected)
.TP
\fB\-u, \-\-unlock\fR
.br
Unlock libraries GTK+, QT, FLTK, Wine.
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Give verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-c, \-\-clocksource\fR (\fI h(pet) \fR | \fI s(ystem) \fR)
Select a specific wall clock (HPET timer or the system clock). Asking for
the now removed cycle-counter timer usiung \fI-c c\fR will result in
the use of the system clock.
.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print the current JACK version number and exit.
.SS ALSA BACKEND OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-C, \-\-capture\fR [ \fIname\fR ]
Provide only capture ports, unless combined with \-D or \-P.  Parameterally set 
capture device name.
.TP
\fB\-d, \-\-device \fIname\fR
.br
The ALSA pcm device \fIname\fR to use.  If none is specified, JACK will
use "hw:0", the first hardware card defined in \fB/etc/modules.conf\fR.
.TP
\fB\-z, \-\-dither [rectangular,triangular,shaped,none]
Set dithering mode.  If \fBnone\fR or unspecified, dithering is off.
Only the first letter of the mode name is required.
.TP
\fB\-D, \-\-duplex\fR
Provide both capture and playback ports.  Defaults to on unless only one 
of \-P or \-C is specified.
.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR Print a brief usage message describing only the
\fBalsa\fR backend parameters.
.TP
\fB\-M, \-\-hwmeter\fR
.br
Enable hardware metering for devices that support it.  Otherwise, use
software metering.
.TP
\fB\-H, \-\-hwmon\fR
.br
Enable hardware monitoring of capture ports.  This is a method for
obtaining "zero latency" monitoring of audio input.  It requires
support in hardware and from the underlying ALSA device driver.

When enabled, requests to monitor capture ports will be satisfied by
creating a direct signal path between audio interface input and output
connectors, with no processing by the host computer at all.  This
offers the lowest possible latency for the monitored signal.

Presently (March 2003), only the RME Hammerfall series and cards based
on the ICE1712 chipset (M\-Audio Delta series, Terratec, and others)
support \fB\-\-hwmon\fR.  In the future, some consumer cards may also
be supported by modifying their mixer settings.

Without \fB\-\-hwmon\fR, port monitoring requires JACK to read audio
into system memory, then copy it back out to the hardware again,
imposing the basic JACK system latency determined by the
\fB\-\-period\fR and \fB\-\-nperiods\fR parameters.
.TP
\fB\-i, \-\-inchannels \fIint\fR
.br
Number of capture channels.  Default is maximum supported by hardware.
.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-nperiods \fIint\fR
.br
Specify the number of periods of playback latency.  In seconds, this
corresponds to \fB\-\-nperiods\fR times \fB\-\-period\fR divided by
\fB\-\-rate\fR.  The default is 2, the minimum allowable.  For most
devices, there is no need for any other value with the
\fB\-\-realtime\fR option.  Without realtime privileges or with boards
providing unreliable interrupts (like ymfpci), a larger value may
yield fewer xruns.  This can also help if the system is not tuned for
reliable realtime scheduling.

For most ALSA devices, the hardware buffer has exactly
\fB\-\-period\fR times \fB\-\-nperiods\fR frames.  Some devices demand
a larger buffer.  If so, JACK will use the smallest possible buffer
containing at least \fB\-\-nperiods\fR, but the playback latency does
not increase.

For USB audio devices it is recommended to use \fB\-n 3\fR. Firewire
devices supported by FFADO (formerly Freebob) are configured with
\fB\-n 3\fR by default.
.TP
\fB\-o, \-\-outchannels \fIint\fR
.br
Number of playback channels.  Default is maximum supported by hardware.
.TP
\fB\-P, \-\-playback\fR [ \fIname\fR ]
Provide only playback ports, unless combined with \-D or \-C.  Optionally set 
playback device name.
.TP
\fB\-p, \-\-period \fIint\fR
.br
Specify the number of frames between JACK \fBprocess()\fR calls.  This
value must be a power of 2, and the default is 1024.  If you need low 
latency, set \fB\-p\fR as low as you can go without seeing xruns.  A larger 
period size yields higher latency, but makes xruns less likely.  The JACK 
capture latency in seconds is \fB\-\-period\fR divided by \fB\-\-rate\fR.
.TP
\fB\-r, \-\-rate \fIint\fR
Specify the sample rate.  The default is 48000.
.TP
\fB\-S, \-\-shorts
.br
Try to configure card for 16\-bit samples first, only trying 32\-bits if
unsuccessful.  Default is to prefer 32\-bit samples.
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-softmode\fR 
.br
Ignore xruns reported by the ALSA driver.  This makes JACK less likely
to disconnect unresponsive ports when running without \fB\-\-realtime\fR.
.TP
\fB\-X, \-\-midi seq
.br
Provide bridging between ALSA MIDI and JACK MIDI (using the ALSA
sequencer system). All ALSA MIDI clients and MIDI hardware that exist
when jackd starts will be represented by JACK MIDI ports. 
.br
The "seq" argument has been retained from older versions of JACK, in
part to provide for the possibility of alternate implementations.

low\-latency kernel can handle these values reliably.  Some can do
better.  If you get xrun messages, try a larger buffer.  Tuning a

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.br
JACK is evolving a mechanism for automatically starting the server
when needed.  Any client started without a running JACK server will
attempt to start one itself using the command line found in the first
line of \fB$HOME/.jackdrc\fR if it exists, or \fB/etc/jackdrc\fR if it
does not.  If neither file exists, a built\-in default command will be
used, including the \fB\-T\fR flag, which causes the server to shut
down when all clients have exited.

As a transition, this only happens when \fB$JACK_START_SERVER\fR is
defined in the environment of the calling process.  In the future this
will become normal behavior.  In either case, defining
\fB$JACK_NO_START_SERVER\fR disables this feature.

To change where JACK looks for the backend drivers, set
\fB$JACK_DRIVER_DIR\fR.

\fB$JACK_DEFAULT_SERVER\fR specifies the default server name.  If not
defined, the string "default" is used.  If set in their respective
environments, this affects \fBjackd\fR unless its \fB\-\-name\fR
parameter is set, and all JACK clients unless they pass an explicit
name to \fBjack_client_open()\fR.
